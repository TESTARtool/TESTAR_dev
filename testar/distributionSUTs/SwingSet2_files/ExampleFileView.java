/**
 * A convenience implementation of the FileView interface that

 *
 * This this implemention will work well with file systems that use
 * "dot" extensions to indicate file type. For example: "picture.gif"
 * as a gif image.
 *
 * If the java.io.File ever contains some of this information, such as
 * file type, icon, and hidden file inforation, this implementation may

 *
 * Example:
 *    JFileChooser chooser = new JFileChooser();
 *    fileView = new ExampleFileView();
 *    fileView.putIcon("jpg", new ImageIcon("images/jpgIcon.jpg"));
 *    fileView.putIcon("gif", new ImageIcon("images/gifIcon.gif"));
 *    chooser.setFileView(fileView);
