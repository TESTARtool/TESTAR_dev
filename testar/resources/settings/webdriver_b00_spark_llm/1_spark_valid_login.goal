Feature: User Valid Login
  As a registered user
  I want to be able to sign in to the application
  So that I can access to the user dashboard

  Background:
    Given the login page is displayed

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    When I enter the valid username 'user'
    And I enter the valid password 'pass'
    And I click the 'Sign In' button
    Then I should be able to observe the user dashboard
