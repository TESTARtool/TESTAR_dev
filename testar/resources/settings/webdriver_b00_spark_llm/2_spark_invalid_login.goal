Feature: User Invalid Login
  As a non registered user
  I should not be able to sign in to the application

  Background:
    Given the login page is displayed

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials
    When I enter a random username value
    And I enter a random password value
    And I click the 'Sign In' button
    Then a message should appear to indicate these are invalid credentials
