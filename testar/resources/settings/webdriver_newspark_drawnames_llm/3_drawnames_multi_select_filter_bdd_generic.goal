Feature: Multi-select filters
  As a customer
  I want to select multiple filters in the gift finder
  So that I can discover more relevant and personalized gift options

  Background:
    Given the Drawnames home page is displayed

  Scenario: Filter results using multiple selections
    When I navigate to the gift finder
    And I select multiple categories
    And I select multiple age groups
    Then I should see product results that match the selected filters
