Price filter from - to / price slider
- Reason
Customers are currently limited in filtering by price because they are forced to search only within a limited price range.
- Goal
Customers can filter within a range of their choosing and are not stuck with a specific range as is currently the case.
- Task Description
Adjust the price filter to:
1. From - to input field with predefined amounts
2. Introduce a price slider with the same price options
- Validation
Customers can specify a price range using both the from - to input fields and the slider.
