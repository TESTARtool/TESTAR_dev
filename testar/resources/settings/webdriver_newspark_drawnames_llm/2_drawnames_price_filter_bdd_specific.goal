Feature: Price filter with slider
  As a customer
  I want to adjust the price filter
  So that I can filter gifts within a custom price range

  Background:
    Given the Drawnames home page is displayed

  Scenario: Filter results using a custom price range
    When I navigate to the gift finder
    And I open the price filter
    And I set a minimum price of $20 and a maximum price of $100
    Then I should see product results that fall within the selected price range
