### About Yolo version
Yolo version 5 is used. The latest version is available on https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5

However, we started with a version downloaded from the above website and did not update during development.
The applicable version is available here:
https://gitlab.com/DirkVerlinden/yolo-integration-testar

The Python source files must be installed in an arbitrary folder on the hard drive and are referenced as an external resource (see test.settings).

### Trained Yolo model for GUI widget detection
The weights for the trained Yolo model are also an external resource.
The latest trained model (yolo_weights.pt) for GUI widget detection is available on
https://gitlab.com/DirkVerlinden/yolo-integration-testar

The weights file can be installed in the same folder as the Python source files to keep all Yolo related files together.
