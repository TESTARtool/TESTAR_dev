 * - Creating JSON files with information about the widgets and their locations on the screenshots
 * - State model learning and saving state models into graph database (OrientDB).
 *   (NOTE: the state model has to be enabled in test settings and OrientDB has to be installed)
 * - Using the learned state model for improved action selection, prioritizing unvisited actions and using the state model as a map
