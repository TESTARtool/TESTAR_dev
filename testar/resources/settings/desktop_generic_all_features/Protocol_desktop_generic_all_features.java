/**
 * This protocol combines different functionalities of TESTAR for testing Windows desktop applications
 * into one protocol.
 *
 * The optional features are commented out with short documentation s.t. you can turn them on again if you want.
 *
 * This protocol includes:
 * - HTML reports of the executed test sequences with screenshots of the GUI states
 * - Creating JSON files with information about the widgets and their locations on the screenshots
 * - State model learning and saving state models into graph database (OrientDB).
 *   (NOTE: the state model has to be enabled in test settings and OrientDB has to be installed)
 * - Using the learned state model for improved action selection, prioritizing unvisited actions and using the state model as a map
