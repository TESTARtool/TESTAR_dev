/**
 * AtspiRelationType specifies a relationship between objects (possibly one-to-many or many-to-one) outside of the
 * normal parent/child hierarchical relationship. It allows better semantic identification of how objects are
 * associated with one another. For instance the ATSPI_RELATION_LABELLED_BY relationship may be used to identify
 * labelling information that should accompany the accessible name property when presenting an object's content or
 * identity to the end user. Similarly, ATSPI_RELATION_CONTROLLER_FOR can be used to further specify the context in
 * which a valuator is useful, and/or the other UI components which are directly effected by user interactions with
 * the valuator. Common examples include association of scrollbars with the viewport or panel which they control.
 *
 * Enumeration used to specify the type of relation encapsulated in an AtspiRelation object
