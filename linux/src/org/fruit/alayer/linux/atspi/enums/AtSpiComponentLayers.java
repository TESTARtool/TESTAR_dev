/**
 * The AtspiComponentLayer of an AtspiComponent instance indicates its relative stacking order with respect
 * to the onscreen visual representation of the UI. AtspiComponentLayer, in combination with AtspiComponent
 * bounds information, can be used to compute the visibility of all or part of a component. This is important
 * in programmatic determination of region-of-interest for magnification, and in flat screen review models of
 * the screen, as well as for other uses. Objects residing in two of the AtspiComponentLayer categories support
 * further z-ordering information, with respect to their peers in the same layer: namely, ATSPI_LAYER_WINDOW and
 * ATSPI_LAYER_MDI . Relative stacking order for other objects within the same layer is not available; the
 * recommended heuristic is first child paints first. In other words, assume that the first siblings in the
 * child list are subject to being overpainted by later siblings if their bounds intersect. The order of
 * layers, from bottom to top, is: ATSPI_LAYER_BACKGROUND , ATSPI_LAYER_WINDOW , ATSPI_LAYER_MDI ,
 * ATSPI_LAYER_CANVAS , ATSPI_LAYER_WIDGET , ATSPI_LAYER_POPUP , and ATSPI_LAYER_OVERLAY .
