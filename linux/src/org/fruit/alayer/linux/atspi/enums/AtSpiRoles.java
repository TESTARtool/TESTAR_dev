Examples in which ATSPI_ROLE_STATIC is appropriate include the message displayed in a message box and an image used as an alternative means to display text. ATSPI_ROLE_STATIC should not be applied to widgets which are traditionally interactive, objects which display a significant amount of content, or any object which has an accessible relation pointing to another object. The displayed information, as a general rule, should be exposed through the accessible name of the object. For labels which describe another widget, see ATSPI_ROLE_LABEL . For text views, see ATSPI_ROLE_TEXT . For generic containers, see ATSPI_ROLE_PANEL . For objects whose role is not known by the implementor, see ATSPI_ROLE_UNKNOWN . Since : 2.16.
