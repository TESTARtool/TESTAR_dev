Hello,

This is the Docker image of TESTAR. The image runs with its own Chrome on a framebuffer. There is an X-server in the image that is not accessible by default.
Mount /testar/bin/output to a central location to gather the log files.
Mount /testar/bin/settings to a certal location to have the settings configuration

Take care of setting ShowVisualSettingsDialog to False in the settings file as well.
Take care of the following settings in the used settings file:
- Mode should be Generate
- SUTConnectorValue should contain the reference "/usr/bin/chromedriver" (the internal chromedriver of the Docker container)
- ShowSettingsAfterTest should be false
- VisualizeSelectedAction should be false
- ShowVisualSettingsDialogOnStartup should be false
- FlashFeedback should be false
- ProtocolCompileDirectory should be set to a directory local to the image e.g. /tmp (this is where the compiled java files are written to)

If NUNIT Output is desired set ReportingClass to NUNIT 3.0 Reporting

Setup state model as required

Furthermore place a .sse file in the settings root to run the specific implementation
