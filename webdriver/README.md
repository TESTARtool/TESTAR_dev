### Usage of TESTAR-webdriver

The webdriver version of TESTAR is developed to better handle web applications.
For various reasons, the desktop version doesn't recognize the non-native widgets available in websites.
TESTAR webdriver tries to remedy this by looking at the DOM and adding a (JS) web extension to the browser.
An additional advantage is the fact that it is safe to run the webdriver version 'natively',
i.e. it is not necessary to run TESTAR webdriver in a VM.

The webdriver version of TESTAR is tested on 3 mayor platforms : Windows 10, OS X and Linux.
It has been tested with Chrome/Chromium, Firefox and Edge (Windows).
That said, using Chrome seems to be the most performant option.

#### Prerequisites

Make sure the conditions to run the desktop version of TESTAR are met, i.e. Java and Gradle are installed.
Next, download a webdriver for the browser to use, the browser itself also needs to be installed.
- Chrome/Chromium : http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
- Firefox : https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
- Edge : https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/  
  Make sure the downloaded version matches the installed Edge version.

Place the driver in an accessible location.
This location needs to be first argument in the SUTConnectorValue, either via the test.settings file,
or edited via the TESTAR GUI. Adjust the other settings if needed, window size comes to mind.

#### Running

On Windows, open a command windows and go to the root TESTAR directory.
In this directory, run TESTAR with :  
$ gradle runTestar

On OS X and Linux, open a terminal and build TESTAR with the following command :  
$ gradle installDist  
Next cd to the installation directory :  
$ cd testar/target/install/testar/bin  
And start TESTAR  
$ ./testar


On OS X, the terminal needs to be allowed to control the computer.  
Under _System Preferences_, _Security & Privacy_, _Accessibility_ allow the terminal.

#### Extra options in Protocol_webdriver_generic

While the webdriver tries to find all clickable elements on the page via the _onclick_ attribute or eventlistener, this is not sufficient for certain web frameworks that use global eventlisteners. Global eventListeners use class attributes to determine the required actions when the element is clicked. The protocol allows the tester to add these attributes to _clickableClasses_.

Because the webdriver is dependent on the use of the (Javascript) web extension, it fails when the browser encounters PDFs or images. With the _deniedExtensions_ option the testar can deny these URLs.

While testing web applications, it is desirable to keep the testing on the same domain. Many applications have links pointing to domains outside the scope. When the browser reaches a domain not defined in _webDomainsAllowed_ it will try to go back to the last allowed page. Related to this is the _followLinks_ option to follow links opened in new tabs or stay with the original tab. 

The _login_, _username_ and _password_ pairs allow TESTAR to automatically login on websites that need authentication. The first pair consists of the URL with the login and the id of the FORM. The next 2 items should contain the ids of the input fields with their credential values.

The last configurable item, _policyAttributes_, is a list of attribute names and values. When the deriveAction method finds all these name-value pairs on an element, a click action is forced. This is used to automate the removal of annoying policy popups.
