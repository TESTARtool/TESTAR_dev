	/////////////// GENERAL PROPERTIES ///////////

	/**
	 * Type of a widget in localized form (language)
	 * From the UIA documentation:
	 *
	 * Identifies the LocalizedControlType property, which is a text string describing the type of control that the automation element represents. The string should contain only lowercase characters:
	 * Correct: "button"
	 * Incorrect: "Button"
	 *
	 * When LocalizedControlType is not specified by the element provider, the default localized string is supplied by the framework, according to the control type of the element (for example, "button" for the Button control type). An automation element with the Custom control type must support a localized control type string that represents the role of the element (for example, "color picker" for a custom control that enables users to choose and specify colors).
	 * When a custom value is supplied, the string must match the application UI language or the operating system default UI language.
	 * Variant type: VT_BSTR
	 * Default value: empty string

	 * UIA Type name of a widget. From the UIA documentation:
	 *
	 * Identifies the ItemType property, which is a text string describing the type of the automation element.
	 * ItemType is used to obtain information about items in a list, tree view, or data grid. For example, an item in a file directory view might be a "Document File" or a "Folder".
	 * When ItemType is supported, the string must match the application UI language or the operating system default UI language.

	/**
	 * From the UIA documentation:
	 *
	 * Identifies the ItemStatus property, which is a text string describing the status of an item of the automation element.
	 * ItemStatus enables a client to ascertain whether an element is conveying status about an item as well as what the status is. For example, an item associated with a contact in a messaging application might be "Busy" or "Connected".
	 * When ItemStatus is supported, the string must match the application UI language or the operating system default UI language.

	/**
	 * Help text of a widget. From the UIA documentation:
	 *
	 * Identifies the HelpText property, which is a help text string associated with the automation element.
	 * The HelpText property can be supported with placeholder text appearing in edit or list controls. For example, "Type text here for search" is a good candidate the HelpText property for an edit control that places the text prior to the user's actual input. However, it is not adequate for the name property of the edit control.

	 * Variant type: VT_BSTR
	 * Default value: empty string
	 */

	/**
	 * Title or name of a widget.
	 * From the UIA documentation:
	 *
	 * Identifies the Name property, which is a string that holds the name of the automation element.
	 * The Name property should be the same as the label text on screen. For example, Name should be "Browse" for a button element with the label "Browse". The Name property must not include the mnemonic character for the access keys (that is, "&"), which is underlined in the UI text presentation. Also, the Name property should not be an extended or modified version of the on-screen label because the inconsistency between the name and the label can cause confusion among client applications and users.
	 * When the corresponding label text is not visible on screen, or when it is replaced by graphics, alternative text should be chosen. The alternative text should be concise, intuitive, and localized to the application UI language, or to the operating system default UI language. The alternative text should not be a detailed description of the visual details, but a concise description of the UI function or feature as if it were labeled by simple text. For example, the Windows Start menu button is named "Start" (button) instead of "Windows Logo on blue round sphere graphics" (button). For more information, see Creating Text Equivalents for Images.
	 * When a UI label uses text graphics (for example, using ">>" for a button that adds an item from left to right), the Name property should be overridden by an appropriate text alternative (for example, "Add"). However the practice of using text graphics as a UI label is discouraged due to both localization and accessibility concerns.
	 * The Name property must not include the control role or type information, such as "button" or "list"; otherwise, it will conflict with the text from the LocalizedControlType property when these two properties are appended (many existing assistive technologies do this).
	 * The Name property cannot be used as a unique identifier among siblings. However, as long as it is consistent with the UI presentation, the same Name value can be supported among peers. For test automation, the clients should consider using the AutomationId or RuntimeId property.
	 * Text controls do not always have to have the Name property be identical to the text that is displayed within the control, so long as the Text pattern is also supported.

	 * Each locale has a unique identifier, a 32-bit value that consists of a language identifier and a sort order identifier. The locale identifier is a standard international numeric abbreviation and has the components necessary to uniquely identify one of the installed operating system-defined locales. For more information, see Language Identifier Constants and Strings.

	 * When it is available, the AutomationId of an element must be the same in any instance of the application, regardless of the local language. The value should be unique among sibling elements, but not necessarily unique across the entire desktop. For example, multiple instances of an application, or multiple folder views in Microsoft Windows Explorer, can contain elements with the same AutomationId property, such as "SystemMenuBar".
	 * Although support for AutomationId is always recommended for better automated testing support, this property is not mandatory. Where it is supported, AutomationId is useful for creating a test automation script that runs regardless of the UI language. Clients should make no assumptions regarding the AutomationId values exposed by other applications. AutomationId is not guaranteed to be stable across different releases or builds of an application.

	/*
	Not implemented yet at this point:

	-AnnotationObjectsPropertyId
	Identifies the AnnotationObjects property, which is a list of annotation objects in a document, such as comment, header, footer, and so on.
	Variant type: VT_I4 | VT_ARRAY
	Default value: empty array

	-AnnotationTypesPropertyId
	Identifies the AnnotationTypes property, which is a list of the types of annotations in a document, such as comment, header, footer, and so on.
	Variant type: VT_I4 | VT_ARRAY
	Default value: empty array

	-CenterPointPropertyId
	Identifies the CenterPoint property, which specifies the center X and Y point coordinates of the automation element. The coordinate space is what the provider logically considers a page.
	Variant type: VT_R8 | VT_ARRAY
	Default value: VT_EMPTY

	-ClickablePointPropertyId
	Identifies the ClickablePoint property, which is a point on the automation element that can be clicked. An element cannot be clicked if it is completely or partially obscured by another window.
	Variant type: VT_R8 | VT_ARRAY
	Default value: VT_EMPTY

	-UIA_ControllerForPropertyId
	Identifies the ControllerFor property, which is an array of automation elements that are manipulated by the automation element that supports this property.
	ControllerFor is used when an automation element affects one or more segments of the application UI or the desktop; otherwise, it is hard to associate the impact of the control operation with UI elements.
	This identifier is commonly used for Auto-suggest accessibility.
	Variant type for providers: VT_UNKNOWN | VT_ARRAY
	Variant type for clients: VT_UNKNOWN (IUIAutomationElementArray )
	Default value: empty array

	-UIA_DescribedByPropertyId
	Identifies the DescribedBy property, which is an array of elements that provide more information about the automation element.
	DescribedBy is used when an automation element is explained by another segment of the application UI. For example, the property can point to a text element of "2,529 items in 85 groups, 10 items selected" from a complex custom list object. Instead of using the object model for clients to digest similar information, the DescribedBy property can offer quick access to the UI element that may already offer useful end-user information that describes the UI element.
	Variant type for providers: VT_UNKNOWN | VT_ARRAY
	Variant type for clients: VT_UNKNOWN (IUIAutomationElementArray)
	Default value: empty array

	-UIA_FillColorPropertyId
	Identifies the FillColor property, which specifies the color used to fill the automation element. This attribute is specified as a COLORREF, a 32-bit value used to specify an RGB or RGBA color.
	Variant type: VT_I4
	Default value: 0

	-UIA_FillTypePropertyId
	Identifies the FillType property, which specifies the pattern used to fill the automation element, such as none, color, gradient, picture, pattern, and so on.
	Variant type: VT_I4
	Default value: 0

	-UIA_FlowsFromPropertyId
	Identifies the FlowsFrom property, which is an array of automation elements that suggests the reading order before the current automation element. Supported starting with Windows 8.
	The FlowsFrom property specifies the reading order when automation elements are not exposed or structured in the same reading order as perceived by the user. While the FlowsFrom property can specify multiple preceding elements, it typically contains only the prior element in the reading order.
	Variant type for providers: VT_UNKNOWN | VT_ARRAY
	Variant type for clients: VT_UNKNOWN (IUIAutomationElementArray)
	Default value: empty array

	-UIA_FlowsToPropertyId
	Identifies the FlowsTo property, which is an array of automation elements that suggests the reading order after the current automation element.
	The FlowsTo property specifies the reading order when automation elements are not exposed or structured in the same reading order as perceived by the user. While the FlowsTo property can specify multiple succeeding elements, it typically contains only the next element in the reading order.
	Variant type for providers: VT_UNKNOWN | VT_ARRAY
	Variant type for clients: VT_UNKNOWN (IUIAutomationElementArray)
	Default value: empty array

	-UIA_HeadingLevelPropertyId
	Identifies the HeadingLevel property, which indicates the heading level of a UI Automation element.
	Variant type: VT_I4
	Default value: HeadingLevel_None

	-UIA_OptimizeForVisualContentPropertyId
	Identifies the OptimizeForVisualContent property, which is a Boolean value that indicates whether the provider exposes only elements that are visible. A provider can use this property to optimize performance when working with very large pieces of content. For example, as the user pages through a large piece of content, the provider can destroy content elements that are no longer visible. When a content element is destroyed, the provider should return the UIA_E_ELEMENTNOTAVAILABLE error code. Supported starting with Windows 8.
	Variant type: VT_BOOL
	Default value: FALSE

	-UIA_OutlineColorPropertyId
	Identifies the OutlineColor property, which specifies the color used for the outline of the automation element. This attribute is specified as a COLORREF, a 32-bit value used to specify an RGB or RGBA color.
	Variant type: VT_I4 | VT_ARRAY
	Default value: 0

	-UIA_OutlineThicknessPropertyId
	Identifies the OutlineThickness property, which specifies the width for the outline of the automation element.
	Variant type: VT_R8 | VT_ARRAY
	Default value: VT_EMPTY

	-UIA_SizePropertyId
	Identifies the Size property, which specifies the width and height of the automation element.
	Variant type: VT_R8 | VT_ARRAY
	Default value: VT_EMPTY
