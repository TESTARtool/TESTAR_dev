## README

This is the github development root folder for TESTAR development. 
The software can be build with both ant and gradle.

### Required tools to build the software

In order to build the native code, a view manual steps need to be executed;

1. In order to build the windows native code, Nmake and the compile for Microsoft visual studio are required.
These tools can be downloaded using the following [link](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=15#).
2. Install the Visual Studio tools on your machine (remember the path where the tools are installed)
3. Download [compile_w10.bat](https://github.com/florendg/testar_floren/releases/download/PERFORMANCE/compile_w10.bat) 
and [clean_w10.bat](https://github.com/florendg/testar_floren/releases/download/PERFORMANCE/clean_w10.bat)
4. Copy clean.bat and compile.bat to the folder windows/native_src within the TESTAR project
5. Adapt compile.bat and clean.bat. Set *PATH* to the installation folder used in step 2.
CALL "C:<*PATH*>\2017\BuildTools\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat" -arch=x64

It should be possible to build the project using the instructions provided in the next section

### Gradle build

To build the Gradle project and run it execute the following procedure;

1. Run `.\gradlew installDist` in the root of the project
2. Change directory to testar/target/install/bin
3. Run testar.bat

It is also possible to generate a zip file containing TESTAR. This zip can be extracted on any other machine
that has a 64-bit Windows operating system and Visual Studio redistributable installed. A proper way of using
TESTAR is to run the tool in a virtual-machine.
To build the zip execute the following command.

1. Run `.\gradlew distZip` in the root of the project. 
2. Extract the zip on the machine where TESTAR is used.

NOTE: TESTAR requires Visual Redistributable which can be downloaded from the following
 [link](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746572) .Also a JAVA 1.8 JDK is required.

#### Running Gradle in Eclipse
The following procedure has been performed

1. Create a new empty workspace for Eclipse in a folder which is not the folder that contains the source
code.
2. Select File -> Import to open the import dialog
3. Select Gradle -> Existing Gradle project to open te import dialog 
4. Select the folder that contains the root of the source code and start the import

## Known issue
- TESTAR can not be excuted using the gradle task .\gradlew run. 

## GraphDb support
This version of TESTAR supports the output of data to an http://orientdb.com database.
Currently Widget's, Actions, States and there relation are recorded to the graph database. 

### using graphdb on the local filesystem
The easiest way to use the graph database support is to write the database to the local file system
After starting TESTAR, it's required to configure the database settings in the tab "GraphDB".
- url : plocal:&lt;path&gt; (for instance plocal:output/testdb) 
- user: admin
- password: admin
- Check the checkbox.

### using graphdb with orientdb server
In order to use the graphdb feature it's advised to install a graph database on your machine  The current implementation 
of TESTAR has a backend for Orientdb. You can download the
community edition from [orientdb](orientdb.com). Follow the installation instructions to install
the database on your machine. 

When orientdb is started the first time. The root password needs to be configured. Make sure you remember thes password.

In order to use the graphdb feature. A database must be created in Orientdb. To do this follow the following procedure;
- Start the database server (ORIENTDB_HOME/bin/server.bat)
- Start orientdb studio in a webbrowser [http://localhost:2480](http://localhost:2480)
- Choose "New DB" and provide the name, root user and password. (The database will also get a default admin/adimin 
user/password).

After starting TESTAR, it's required to configure the database settings in the tab "GraphDB".
- url : remote:<hostname>/&lt;database name> (for instance remote:/localhost/demo)
- user: admin
- password: admin
- Check the checkbox.

When TESTAR finishes, the data be inspected in the database. The easiest way to see the complete
graph is to type the following query in the graph tab "Select * From E". This will display the complete
graph.

### Exploring the graph database with Gremlin.

[Gremlin](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#_tinkerpop3) is a graph traversel engine which can be used 
to query a graph database. OrientDB supports Gremlin and provides an implementation of the traversal engine in it's 
community release.

To start Gremlin run the following command; orientdb-gremlin. This command is delivered with the community 
edition of Orientdb.

See the manuals of orientdb to learn about the possibilities to query the model.
