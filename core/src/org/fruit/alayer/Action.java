/**
 * Actions take a system and a state as parameters and operate on the system (e.g. a left click). They
 * usually use the state to find certain values that might be necessary for their 
 * execution. In addition they might use a system's devices (Mouse, Keyboard, ...)
 * in order to execute a specific task.
 * For example: An action could always click on a menu item with the title
 * "Create New Document". Therefore it has to search the system's state
 * in order to find this menu item. It then needs to find out the item's position
 * and obtain the mouse device from the system in order to actually issue the click.
 * If it fails to do any of these tasks, it raises an exception.
 * Like states and systems, actions can have properties attached to them.
 * 
 * An action should be serializable, so that it can be stored and replayed.
