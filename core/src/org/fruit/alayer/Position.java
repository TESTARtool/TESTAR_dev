 * A position is a function that operates on a state and calculates a concrete point.
 * For example: A position could calculate "The center of the Button with the title 'OK'".
 * In order to do that, the position first needs to find the Button within the widget tree
 * (i.e. the state). Then it will get the button's <code>Shape</code> tag and calculate
 * the center position.
