 * <code>Taggable</code>'s are a essential part of the FRUIT library. A taggable object can carry <code>Tag</code>'s which

 * You can also add additional tags to or remove specific ones from a taggable object.

 * You can think of <code>Taggable</code>'s as Java's <code>Map</code>'s. The difference is that they can contain objects
 * of different types, yet type safety is still enforced.
